# CodeStats

Creates statistics about source codes, much like cloc or similar programs. Same-same, only different.

CodeStat can be used in a directory to scan a whole project.

Example output:

```$ codestats 
All lines:       507
Comments:        14
Empty lines:     100
Effective lines: 393
Repeating lines: 15
Repetitions:     156
Net lines:       351
Languages: Cabal, Haskell, Yaml, Text
```
